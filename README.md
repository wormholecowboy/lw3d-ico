Learn Web3 Dao: ICO tutorial

This was a fun project that is connected to the previous ones. It uses the NFT from the previous lesson to validate the wallet and allow it to mint 10 tokens. Also has a price built in for public sale. Had to work out a couple bugs along the way, but overall, pretty easy.
